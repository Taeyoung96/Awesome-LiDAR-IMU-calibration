:sunglasses: A current list of LiDAR-IMU calibration method

## Introduction  

LiDAR and IMU are among the widely used sensors in the field of self-driving cars and robotics. To fuse both sensors and use them for algorithms (such as LiDAR-inertial SLAM), it is essential to obtain the exact extrinsic parameter.  

Inspired by [Deephome/Awesome-LiDAR-Camera-Calibration](https://github.com/Deephome/Awesome-LiDAR-Camera-Calibration), this repository summarizes the LiDAR-IMU calibration methods currently being studied in research fields and related toolboxes.

The figure above is one of the figures in the paper "Target-free Extrinsic Calibration of a 3D-Lidar and an IMU".
